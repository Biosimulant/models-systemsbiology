**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2211030001)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Joseph Masison; Mendes P

## Description

This is a small model of ferritin iron sequestration kinetics. The model’s parameter values were determined from published kinetic and binding experiments and the model was validated against independe

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2406180001)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Ralf H Bortfeldt; Stefan Schuster; Ina Koch

## Description

We designed a structured model of spliceosome assembly, which combines the demands on a platform that i) can display involved factors and concurrent processes, ii) offers the possibility to run comput


## Usage

# Chi2019 - In Silico Prediction of PAMPA Effective Permeability Using a Two-QSAR Approach

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2406030003)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Cheng-Ting Chi; Ming-Han Lee; Ching-Feng Weng; Max K Leong

## Description

The authors provide a dataset of 200 small molecules and their experimentally measured permeability in a PAMPA assay. Using this data, we have trained a model that predicts the logarithm of the effect


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

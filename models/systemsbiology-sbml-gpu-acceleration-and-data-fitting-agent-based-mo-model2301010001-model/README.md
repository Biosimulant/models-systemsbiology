## Description

Abstract from paper: 'For many years, infectious disease modelers have used agent-based models to study the spread of viruses, but the models were too computationally intensive to fully replicate even


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
models:
  - repo: Biosimulant/models
    alias: model
    manifest_path: models/systemsbiology-sbml-gpu-acceleration-and-data-fitting-agent-based-mo-model2301010001-model/model.yaml

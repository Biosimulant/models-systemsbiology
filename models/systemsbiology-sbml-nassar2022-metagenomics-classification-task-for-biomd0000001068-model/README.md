## Description

This is a use case to show that, given any automatic metagenomic classification model for the documents, we can convert those to ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format; it also consists of the Doc


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
models:
  - repo: Biosimulant/models
    alias: model

# Wong2024 - Cytotoxicity Prediction from Human Cell Lines

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2405130002)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Felix Wong; Erica J Zheng; Jacqueline A Valeri; Nina M Donghia; Melis N Anahtar

## Description

The authors use a large dataset (>30k) to train an explainable graph-based model to identify potential antibiotics with low cytotoxicity. The model uses a substructure-based approach to explore the ch


## Usage

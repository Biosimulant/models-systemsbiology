## Description

This is the base grover model. GROVER is a self-supervised Graph Neural Network for molecular representation pretrained with 10 million unlabelled molecules from ChEMBL and ZINC15, and has been fine-t


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:

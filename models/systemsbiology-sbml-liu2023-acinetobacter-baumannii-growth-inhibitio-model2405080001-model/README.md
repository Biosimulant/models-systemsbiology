**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Gary Liu; Denise B Catacutan; Khushi Rathod; Kyle Swanson; Wengong Jin

## Description

This model is a Chemprop neural network trained with a growth inhibition dataset. Authors screened ~7,500 molecules for those that inhibited the growth of A. baumannii in vitro. They discovered abauci


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

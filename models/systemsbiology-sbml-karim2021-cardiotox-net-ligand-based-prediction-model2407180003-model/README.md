# Karim2021 - CardioTox net: Ligand-based prediction of hERG blockade

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2407180003)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Abdul Karim; Matthew Lee; Thomas Balle; Abdul Sattar

## Description

A robust predictor for hERG channel blockade based on an ensemble of five deep learning models. The authors have collected a dataset from public sources, such as BindingDB and ChEMBL on hERG blockers 


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
models:
  - repo: Biosimulant/models
    alias: model
    manifest_path: models/systemsbiology-sbml-karim2021-cardiotox-net-ligand-based-prediction-model2407180003-model/model.yaml

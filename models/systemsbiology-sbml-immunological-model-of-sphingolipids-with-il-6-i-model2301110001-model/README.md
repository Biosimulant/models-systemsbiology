# Immunological Model of sphingolipids with IL-6/IL-17/IL-23 in L. major infection

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2301110001)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Diksha Jawale; Shweta Khandibharad; Shailza Singh

## Description

In diseased state, we demonstrated that increase in production of sphingosine-1-phosphate and overexpression of IL-6,lL-17 and IL-23 with SATB1 leads to disease progression.


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:

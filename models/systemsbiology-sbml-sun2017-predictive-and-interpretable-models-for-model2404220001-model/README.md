**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Hongmao Sun; Kimloan Nguyen; Edward Kerns; Zhengyin Yan; Kyeong Ri Yu

## Description

Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability is an in vitro surrogate to determine the permeability of drugs across cellular membranes. PAMPA at pH 7.4 was experimentally determined in a dataset of 5,473


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:

**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Yu Rong; Yatao Bian; Tingyang Xu; Weiyang Xie; Ying Wei

## Description

This model has been trained using the GROVER embedding and the the FreeSolv dataset from MoleculeNet. The Model is based on experimental and calculated hydration free energy of small molecules in wate


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:

# Kogan2013 - A mathematical model for the immunotherapeutic control of the TH1 TH2 imbalance in melanoma

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000881)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Kogan, Y.; Agur, Z.; Elishmereni, M.

## Description

This is a mathematical model describing the imbalance between T helper (Th1/Th2) cell types in melanome patients, together with its regulation via IL-12 treatment. The model focuses on the interaction


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

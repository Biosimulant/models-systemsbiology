# Space Prompt - systemsbiology-general-combo-0027

Create a scientifically coherent **systemsbiology / general** comparative space using:
- Base models: systemsbiology-sbml-bialik2010-apoptosis-spikemodel-model1107050000-model, systemsbiology-sbml-birtwistle2007-erbb-signalling-biomd0000000175-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.

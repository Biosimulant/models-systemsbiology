# Space Prompt - systemsbiology-general-combo-0019

Create a scientifically coherent **systemsbiology / general** comparative space using:
- Base models: systemsbiology-sbml-baker2017-the-role-of-cytokines-mmps-and-fibrone-biomd0000000928-model, systemsbiology-sbml-baldwin1994-nondimensionalized-model-of-thrombin-model1806010001-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.

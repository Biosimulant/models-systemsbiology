# models-systemsbiology

Curated collection of **systems biology** simulation models for the **biosim** platform. This repository contains 777 computational models representing integrative systems approaches, multi-scale modeling, and comprehensive biological systems analysis.

## What's Inside

### Models (777 packages)

**Systems Biology** — integrative models, multi-scale dynamics, and systems-level analysis:

**Key Areas:** Integrated cellular systems, multi-pathway networks, genome-scale models, systems pharmacology, synthetic biology circuits, oscillatory systems, feedback networks, and cross-domain biological integration.

This repository contains comprehensive systems-level models that integrate multiple biological processes. All models use SBML format with tellurium runtime.

## Prerequisites
